Create a file named ~/.gatorconfig.json (or similar, based on what your code reads) with content:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/gatordb?sslmode=disable"
}
```
Adjust:

- username
- password
- localhost:5432 (host and port)
- gatordb (database name)
- sslmode if needed

Be sure the database exists and your credentials are correct.
